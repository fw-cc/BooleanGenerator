# BooleanGenerator

Requires Python 3.7+, PIL.

Built to help generating "Must match n" boolean searches.

Run `run.py`, it has a first-time-setup where it installs all dependancies it can (and updates `pip`).

`tkinter` on the top, `asyncio` most of the way through, `itertools` at the bottom.

Shouldn't break (but then again, neither should fighter plane flight computers), if it does, hit the handy refresh button and let me know about the issue.
